# product-inventory-system-


The Product inventory System is a web application that allows users to create, update, list, and delete products. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage product inventory efficiently.

## Features

1. Product Creation
   - Users can enter product details, including:
     - Product Name
     - Description
     - Price
     - Quantity in Stock
   - The new product is saved to the product inventory in the database.
   - The newly added product is displayed in the user's product list.

2. Product Updates
   - Users can mark products as available or out of stock using a checkbox or toggle button.
   - Users can edit product details, including:
     - Product Name
     - Description
     - Price
     - Quantity in Stock
   - The product's information is updated in the database when changes are made.

3. Product List
   - The system retrieves the user's product inventory from the database and displays it in a list format.
   - Product details displayed include:
     - Product Name
     - Description
     - Price
     - Availability (in stock or out of stock)
   - Optional: Implement filters to allow users to display only available or out-of-stock products.

4. Product Deletion
   - Each product in the product list has a delete button or icon.
   - Clicking the delete button removes the product from the product inventory in the database.
   - The product list display is updated to remove the deleted product.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- MySQL (or any other preferred database)

## Database Operations

The application requires a database to store and manage product data. You can use any database of your choice (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB). Perform the following database operations:

- Create a table `products` with the necessary columns to store product details, including:
  - `id` (unique identifier)
  - `name` (product name)
  - `description` (product description)
  - `price` (product price)
  - `quantity` (quantity in stock)
  - `available` (availability status: 1 for available, 0 for out of stock)

Implement the necessary database operations (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, DELETE) in your PHP code to interact with the database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the `products` table.

## API Routes

Expose the following API routes to handle the CRUD operations:

- `POST /products`: Create a new product and save it to the database.
- `PUT /products/:id`: Update an existing product in the database.
- `GET /products`: Retrieve all products from the database.
- `DELETE /products/:id`: Delete a product from the database.

Implement the API routes using PHP and make the necessary database operations to perform the corresponding CRUD actions.
